# Blitz TCG
Welcome to the official repository for Blitz TCG®, an open-source innovative trading card game that redefines the competitive scene by integrating blockchain technology to foster digital ownership and ensure the longevity of the game for its players. Inspired by the timeless appeal of classic TCGs, Blitz TCG® introduces fresh mechanics, merging iconic elements from various game genres to deliver a unique TCG experience.

# Game Overview
Blitz TCG® is not just another card game. It provides players with full access to their decks, employs a chess-like timebank system for dynamic play, features General abilities to augment strategies, and introduces NPC elements to enrich gameplay. Striking a balance between two primary resources, Gold and XP (experience), and selecting a General that synergizes with your deck, opens up a world of strategic depth and tactical finesse.

# Getting Started
To set up your development environment for Blitz TCG®:
**1.** Clone the repository to your local machine.
**2.** Import the project into Unity.
**3.** Before you begin, you will need to obtain your own Photon Unity Networking (PUN) and Google Firebase configuration files, as these have been removed from the repository for security reasons. Please refer to the respective services to generate your google-services.json for Firebase and PhotonServerSettings for PUN.

# License
Anyone can use the resources of Blitz TCG® in their own project or variant of the card game under a single condition:
1. If any of our character cards, e.g., Margo, are used in your game or project, the use or unlock of said character must reference a user's blockchain wallet to confirm ownership. For example, to unlock Margo in your fighting game, you should check a user's blockchain wallet (e.g., Ergo) for Margo's corresponding token ID and unlock Margo for use only if the user owns at least one of the Token IDs for Margo. We are more than happy to assist you with the necessary code to make this process successful and easy. This approach empowers us to provide assets for free, offers our users multiple use cases for their assets, and enables a collaborative approach to IP sharing that benefits everyone.
